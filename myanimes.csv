1413,Donguri to Yamaneko,"The Acorns and the Wildcat is a unique short film in picture book format from the creator of Night on the Galactic Railroad and Gauche the Cellist. Unusually for an anime a narrator reads Kenji s story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can t put your finger on the reason why it s probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii s artsy 1986 feature Angel s Egg. That and Kenji s wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki s Panda.Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji s story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing and Kenji s magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.

Overall a pleasant film that s interesting to watch for the technical aspects but the story leaves much to be desired being on the melodramatic maudlin side.

A boy who is the descendant of the leader of the theives who met a grisly fate in the 1001 Nights bands together with 38 cats and a mouse to get back his rightful treasure from Ali Baba XXXIII the descendent of Ali Baba who now rules the kingdom with an iron fist. This is a reversal of the good guy.bad guy roles in the original story  perhaps not surprising for being a film in which Hayao Miyazaki was involved  This film is one of the most rollicking and action packed films made by Toei and is in an outrageously cartoonish style breaking with the Toei mold. It has a spectacular lineup of animators including Yasuji Mori Akira Daikubara Hayao Miyazaki Yoichi Kotabe and Reiko Okuyama. The original story about Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves itself is recounted at one point in the film in an unexpected and interesting way using shadow puppets.

The reason is very clear the setting of the story is the exhausted earth. There couldn t be a more instructive setting for a power company that uses enormous amounts of the earth s resources. Additionally a girl robot discovered by the main character can store sunlight and convert it into energy in other words the robot does not require a power generating company. In addition to this the robot destroys herself to protect the established solar power generation system in space.  
 
The unsuccessful outcome of the competition for Tezuka Osamu was only natural and it is clear that he created this piece as it was intentionally as he managed everything from the original story to the screenplay animation narration etc. all the while knowing that the competition was sponsored by a power company.
