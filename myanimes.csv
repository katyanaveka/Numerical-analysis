1413,Donguri to Yamaneko,The Acorns and the Wildcat is a unique short film in picture book format from the creator of Night on the Galactic Railroad and Gauche the Cellist. Unusually for an anime a narrator reads Kenji s story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can t put your finger on the reason why it s probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii s artsy 1986 feature Angel s Egg. That and Kenji s wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki s Panda.Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji s story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing and Kenji s magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.

Additionally a girl robot discovered by the main character can store sunlight and convert it into energy in other words the robot does not require a power generating company. In addition to this the robot destroys herself to protect the established solar power generation system in space.
